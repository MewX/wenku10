# Grimoire Reaper ( wenku10 )
This is a versatile book reader with:
- OneDrive syncing for bookmarks
- A spider that can crawl web content into a book ( with an editor )
- A sharing platform for users to share their crawling instructions ( spider script )
- Themes
- Ebwin: an embed dictionary ( I needed this for learning Japanese )
- ...actually it is just a text reader that I created for reading web novel

#### Going to implement
- Faster vertical text rendering ( I am still planning to switch the core components to native library )
- Better design. I don't think if I have time to do this tho
- way to go!
