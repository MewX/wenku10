# What is wenku10
wenku10 versatile book reader that does many things.
#### Current features
- Provide OneDrive syncing for bookmarks
- A spider that can crawl web content into a book
- Themes
- Ebwin: an embed dictionary ( I needed this for learning Japanese, so ... whatever I want! )

#### Going to implement
- Faster vertical text rendering ( I am planning to switch the core components to native library )
- Better design. I don't think if I have time to do this tho
